				<h4>
					Modelling evolution of proteins
				</h4>
				<p>
					University of California, Berkeley, 2010 - Supervisor, Prof. Phillip Geissler
				</p>
				<p>
					In my first semester at UC Berkeley I investigated the option of a cross-disciplinary project between Computer Science and Chemistry. The particular project I started work on involved applying techniques from machine learning to the problem of protein evolution. In particular, we were considering a lattice model of a protein and wanted to characterise how its folding behaviour varied across the space of possible sequences.

				<h4>
					Online detection of transient objects
				</h4>
				<p>
					University of Sydney, Research Assistant, 2010 - Supervisor, Dr. Tara Murphy
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the major challenges in the Square Kilometre Array project is processing the data collected by the telescope fast enough to be able to notice interesting observations while there is still something to look at. This project was an exploration of methods for storing observations, tracking objects and noticing interesting changes.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Task management on the iPad
				</h4>
				<p>
					University of Sydney, Research Assistant, 2010 - Supervisor, Prof. Judy Kay
				</p>
				<p>
					The large screen and direct manipulation interface provided by the iPad is an interesting basis for many applications. Here I worked on the construction of a simple task management application that used location and colour to capture information about tasks (for example, importance, type, and urgency).

				<h4>
					Adaptive Supertagging for Faster Parsing
				</h4>
				<p>
					University of Sydney Honours Thesis, 2009 - Supervisor, Dr James R. Curran
				</p>
				<p>
					My honours thesis investigated adaptive training - using a parser to automatically annotate large amounts of data, which is then used to retrain the parser's supertagger. This leads the supertagger to adapt to the parser, using smaller tag sets while still providing the tags the parser would have used if the sets were larger. This led to speed improvements of between 30% and 86%, with no loss in accuracy. I received a university medal for my work and some of the early results were presented at the Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2009.

				<h4>
					Predicting long-term dynamics of supercooled liquids
				</h4>
				<p>
					Columbia University, NY, Dec 2008 / Jan 2009 - Supervisor, Prof David R. Reichman
				</p>
				
				<p>
					During the summer break after third year I travelled to New York to spend two months working on a research project at Columbia University. I was studying the dynamics of supercooled liquid systems. I implemented a molecular dynamics simulation, two energy minimisation routines and a function to calculate the localised soft modes of a system, all in C++.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Simulating Ion-Surface and Ion-Bulk interactions in Water
				</h4>
				<p>
					Talented Student Program Unit of Study, Semester Two, 2008 - Supervisor, Dr Angus Gray-Weale
				</p>
				<p>
					I developed a simple simulation of water, written in FORTRAN, to search for a new long-range interaction force. We approximated water as a three dimensional matrix of dipoles that are able to change intensity. Using a Monte-Carlo search heuristic with energy calculated using a fast fourier transform routine we were able to find the likely equilibrium state of the system. By considering the variation in dipole behaviour we aimed to approximate the free energy of the system, hoping to find a variation depending on the proximity of the ion to the surface. While the proposed force was not demonstrated, I did show that the model demonstrates a range of water's known properties and developed tools to make execution and analysis simpler.

					Classifying Verb Particle Constructions
				</h4>
				<p>
					Talented Student Program Unit of Study, Semester One, 2008 - Supervisor, Dr James R. Curran
				</p>
				<p>
					I constructed a system in C and Python that uses hashing and template based aggregation to efficiently store the 24Gb of compressed data in the Google Web1T corpus in a quickly queriable form. This system was used to classify Verb-Particle Constructions by applying a linguistic constituency test to determine whether the verb-particle pair given is in fact a VPC. A paper based on this work was accepted for the 2008 Australian Language Technology Workshop.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Project Pronto - Question Classification
				</h4>
				<p>
					Talented Student Program Unit of Study, Semester Two, 2007 - Supervisor, Dr James R. Curran
				
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked in a team, (six in my group, thirteen in the full team), to further develop a system that answers questions posed in natural language. My group divided in two and independently developed programs in python that use machine learning techniques to determine the kind of answer required. As part of the project I also worked with one other member of the team to construct a simple web interface using a combination of python based cgi, a mySQL database, HTML and javascript. The interface allowed the team to easily classify a large set of questions, which could be used in the future as a training set.

				<h4>
					Optimal Packing of Hard Spheres of Two Sizes
				</h4>
				<p>
					Talented Student Program Unit of Study, Semester Two, 2007 - Supervisor, Dr Toby Hudson
				</p>
				<p>
					This project is an extension of the inorganic crystal structures project described below. The work involved writing a Monte-Carlo search heuristic to use currently known binary crystal structures as a starting point for finding the optimal packing configuration for binary hard sphere systems (considering all ratios of radii and ratios of constituents). The results of this worked have subsequently been published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, in the United States.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					Simulating Protein Aggregation in 3D
				</h4>
				<p>
					Physics Lab, Semester Two, 2007 - Supervisor, Dr S Kuyucak
				</p>
				<p>
					In this project I investigated the conditions under which aggregation occurs by using Brownian dynamics and the Monte-Carlo search heuristic to simulate the movements of globular proteins. I wrote in C++, and the main challenge was the physics involved, which was simplified by approximations, but complicated by the discrete nature of steps in the simulation.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Resourceful Reading
				</h4>
				<p>
				
					Casual Job, Winter, 2007 - Supervisor, Dr Katherine Bode
				</p>
				<p>
					I wrote python scripts to take HTML source files about authors and poets from the AusLit database and find certain facts, saving them in a useful format.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Inorganic Crystal Structure Data Mining
				</h4>
				<p>
					Vacation Scholarship Project 2006/7 - Supervisor, Dr Toby Hudson
				</p>
				<p>
					The Inorganic Crystal Database contains descriptions of all inorganic crystals reported, but is not designed for data mining. To convert the data to a more usable form I wrote a simple hotkey macro, a python script and a C program that could extract any set of crystals from the database, filter them, and produce an array of structures containing all properties in appropriate forms. At the end of the project I used the observed separation of atoms in all binary crystals to determine an optimal set of atomic radii (producing a list of radii directly from a large set of experimental observations). The program also included options for analysing particular crystals, for example, producing an output file that could be processed by the visualisation tool xmakemol.

				<h4>
					Developing a Write-Skew Detector
				</h4>
				<p>
					Vacation Scholarship Project 2006/7 - Supervisor, Ass. Prof. Alan Fekete
				</p>
				<p>
					Databases operating under snapshot isolation can experience an error when two records that must satisfy a relation are concurrently edited by transactions that read common records, but do not write common records. In this project I developed a tool in C to detect write-skew errors in logs produced by Berkeley DB. This is achieved by constructing a graph of dependencies between transaction and searching for cycles. When I completed this project I had not learn C formally yet and so the project gave me the opportunity to learn about string manipulation and memory management.

				<h4>
					Copper Oxide Semiconductors
				</h4>
				
				<p>
					Physics Lab, Semester Two, 2006 - Supervisor, Dr Nicholas J. Ekins-Daulkes
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked with another student, synthesising a semi-conducting material based on cuprous oxide by an electrochemical process. We successfully formed a diode and also measured the light absorption behaviour of the material to assess its potential usefulness in solar cells. While the results indicated it had the right properties to be effective, we did not have time to construct a sample solar cell.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Diffusion Synthesis of Copper and Zinc Based Porous Co-ordination Metal-Organic Framework Materials
				</h4>
				<p>
					Talented Student Program Sustainability Project, Semester One, 2006 - Supervisor, Prof. Cameron J. Kepert
				</p>
				<p>
				
					The group, (four students), was synthesising two types of crystals that could store hydrogen. One, the copper based material, had been extensively studied previously, the other, the zinc based one, had only been synthesised once before, and then as a byproduct in a separate experiment. I attempted to synthesise the zinc based material and succeeded in producing crystals that would be capable of storing hydrogen, but their structure was slightly more zinc-rich than expected. The results were particularly exciting because we used a novel diffusion process rather than the solvothermal method often used in the field.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Galactic All Sky Survey Searching Program
				</h4>
				<p>
					Vacation Scholarship Project 2005/6 - Supervisor, Dr Tara Murphy
				</p>
				<p>
					Usually the search for sources in astronomical data is performed by hand over several months by a physicist. To save this time, I developed a program in python that searched the GASS data for hydrogen clouds by applying a variation of the flood-fill algorithm in 3D. The program produced a list of sources and an annotation file used by the visualisation tool kvis to mark the location of sources in images of the data.

					Coursework Projects
				</h3>
				
				<h4>
					Info1903 - Online WordNet query system
				</h4>
				<p>
					This project was completed individually and involved the creation of a cgi script, written in python, that queried a mySQL database and produced valid XHTML and CSS for the response page. Queries included finding synonyms of the given word, how it is pronounced, and how often it occurs in the Penn Treebank dataset.
				</p>
				
				<h4>
					Soft1902 - Library catalogue system
				</h4>
				
				<p>
					This project was completed in a group of four and was written in Java. My most significant contribution was ensuring the code was not susceptible to concurrency errors, while maintaining high throughput. I also developed the simple database management scheme used in the early iterations of the system.

				<h4>
					ELCL5616 - StealthNet
				</h4>
				<p>
					Working in a pair I extended a system for secure communication.
